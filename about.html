      <p class="lead">
       <p>ZeroVex was founded with a simple goal: to help organizations operate confidently and securely in a digital world that’s evolving faster than ever.</p>
      <p>
I’m a cybersecurity and IT professional with over five years of combined experience across IT support, cybersecurity, academic training, and hands-on lab work. My background includes supporting real users and systems, building and securing environments through home labs, completing a B.S. in Cybersecurity, and earning CompTIA Security+ certification. I’m also actively working toward CySA+ to continue deepening my defensive and monitoring expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
What led me to build ZeroVex was seeing a consistent gap; small organizations, nonprofits, and community groups are increasingly dependent on technology, but often lack clear visibility into their security posture. As websites, cloud tools, and online services grow, so does the attack surface. At the same time, malicious tools are becoming more accessible and more automated.
      </p>
<p>
Security shouldn’t feel overwhelming, confusing, or out of reach.
</p>
<p>
ZeroVex focuses on practical protection, not fear-based selling. We start by helping organizations understand where they stand, what’s working, what’s exposed, and what actually matters. That’s why we offer free initial assessments for community organizations: so there’s clarity before commitment.
</p>
<p>
For teams that want ongoing support, we provide monitoring, alerts, and guidance designed to reduce risk without adding operational headaches. Our goal isn’t to flood you with noise, it’s to give you peace of mind, clear documentation, and confidence that someone is watching the right things.
